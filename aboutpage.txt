Thank you for visiting *websitname*! Our goal is to educate generations on sharks and why they arenâ€™t as scary as you think. You can explore different species, their scientific name, what they look like, and look at their shark attack statistics in your area and around the world! Are you afraid of seeing Great Whites at the coast of North Carolina? Check out our map and look to see any shark attacks! Not only this but our website will be able to tell you if the shark attack was provoked or not, meaning if it was the sharks fault or the human poked at the shark. Should you go surfing on Plum Island? You can check this out too! Go to our website to see possible threats and data! We believe as a world we should stop categorizing sharks as scary monsters, and start to look at the real data and see that shark attacks in your area are less likely than you think.
