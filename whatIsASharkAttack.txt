A shark attack is officially described as any attack on a human by a shark, but what does that really mean? 
Does it mean injuries? Deaths? Aggressive conversations?? Shark attacks install a certain amoutn of fear in people, despite their rarity,
because of horror movies like Jaws or 50 Meters Down



Only 1 in 6 shark attacks are fatal.

Sharks are more likely to bite a small section of the body such as an ankle, wrist, arm, or leg. Once the shark discovers it's a human, the shark sometimes stops and swims away. Usually these injuries are minor and accidents. A surfer, swimmer, or kayak, looks very similar to a seal or fish to a shark.
